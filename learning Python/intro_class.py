# data type is a classification, mostly needed for a computer so that the computer can know how you intend to use the data in the future.

# Data type is a container for data. Data structure
# Python comes with built-in data types.
# String - sequence of characters. Strings are immutable.
# int - whole number
# float - number with decimals
# boolean - True or False. immutable
# Dictionary - {'Key': 'Value'}. Apparently the most popular job interview question.'Can tuple be used as a key in a dictionary?'. 'Can you use list as a key in a dictionary?'. Only immutable data type can be used as a key in a dictionary. Int, float, string, boolean, tuple. Anything else can be used as a value.
# list - sequence of values seperated by values, held in [] and has indicies
# tuple - immutable data type held in (). data usually comes in form of tuple. if function returns more than 1 result, it's packaged as a tuple.
# dictionary is fast because keys are unique. If you store phone numbers in a list then you need to iterate.
# set - collection of immutable items. set itself is mutable. 
# range - generates sequence of ints; start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive)
# 1. type
# 2. dir - helps you to see what is possible with current code. 
# 3. help - function that does exactly what it says, 'help'.
